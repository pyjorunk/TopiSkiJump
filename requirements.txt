# This file contains all the third-party dependencies that are needed to run the code in the repository
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
# For the sake of simplicity we list all dependencies in a single file, also the ones which are not
# needed to execute the true program. For example:
pytest
# pytest is actually just a developer dependencies, i.e. something only the developers care about, but
# not the users. In this case the users will simply assume that your program is doing what it is promising
# and that you did write sufficient unit tests to prove it. Users live in the real live and not in a
# test environment.
